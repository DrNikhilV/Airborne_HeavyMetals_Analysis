Airborne Emissions of Heavy Metals and Their Health Implications: A Regional Analysis

This study is significant as it addresses the issue of airborne heavy metal pollution and its
potential health consequences. Heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium are
highly toxic and persistent in the environment, posing long-term risks to human health, including
neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular disorders. By analyzing regional patterns of
emissions, the study can identify high-risk areas, vulnerable populations, and the industries
responsible for elevated pollution levels. The findings are crucial for guiding public health
policies, improving environmental regulations, and targeting interventions to reduce health risks.

This dataset provides detailed information on atmospheric emissions of heavy metal pollutants,
including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, vanadium,
and zinc in the UK. It categorizes emissions by industry according to the Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) 2007, covering approximately 130 sectors from 1990 to 2022. Released
by the UK's Environmental Accounts team, the dataset offers insights into industrial pollution
trends over time, helping to inform environmental policy and research.
